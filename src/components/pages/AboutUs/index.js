              The World Tournament Players Organization (WTPO) is an independent
              organization founded by professionals, for professionals.
            </p>
            <p>
              WTPO was founded by Jarmo Sandelin, who has been a member of the
              Swedish PGA since 1987. Today, he is honorary member of the
              Swedish PGA, Finnish PGA and the British PGA. Sandelin qualified
              for the European Tour in 1995 where he the same year was awarded
              “Sir Henry Cotton Rookie of the Year” and has five tournament
              victories, where he still is a member as well as in Legends Tour.
              In 1996, he played on the PGA tour and in 1999, he played the
              Ryder Cup for the European team.
            </p>
            <p>
              During his career, Sandelin and has visited over 600 golf
              destinations and it is with his combined experience he founded
              WTPO – a platform for World Tournament Players, offering new
              opportunities, new sponsorship concepts and membership services,
              while WTPO monitors members' interests vis-à-vis golf
              organizations and authorities.
            </p>
            <p>
              The WTPO initiative is endorsed by several PGA members throughout
              the world, Tournament Players and club professionals with
              extensive golf experience, and a pronounced interest in continuing
              to develop professional golf.&nbsp;
              <strong>
                All Tournament Players and club professionals around the world
                are welcome to become WTPO members.{" "}
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              The WTPO platform will be a complement to existing competition
              organizations, where WTPO's competitions may be included in their
              schedule.
            </p>
            <p>
              A first step is to engage WTPO members, partners and investors,
              which will continue to December 31, 2023, in order to create
              opportunities for all member categories from 2024 onwards.
